00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,608
My beautiful boy.

One day, I'm gonna find you,

Can't believe we ruined

Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

216
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:23,780
Abdul assaulted me!
She's about 4'4", 40 pounds.

217
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,518
Ah! Why are you doing
this to me?

ruin Christmas

239
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,512

240
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,347
<i>Okay, Sal, when this kid

248
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,163

- Fall asleep, Sal.

249
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,598

250

<i>Look at the...</i>

268
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,155
Hello, darling. How are you?

269
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:49,292
Come sit on Santa's lap.

270
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,394
- And what is your name?
- Casey.

271
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,763
Casey, I want you
to take a minute

272
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,967
and think about what you might
want for Christmas this year.

273
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,334
Just think about it
in your head.

274
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,169
- Okay?
- Uh...

275
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,672
"Don't talk to me
till I tell you."

276
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:05,141
Now, don't talk
until I tell you, Casey.

277
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,642
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

278
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:13,716
"Now, why aren't you saying anything to Santa?"

279
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,852
I don't have all day, Casey.
Do you know what you want?

280
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,119
- Yes.
- Okay.

281
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,889
Don't speak
until I tell you, now.

282
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,423
<i>She's so cute.</i>

283
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,757
Whenever you're ready,
just tell me what you want.

284
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,926
<i>Keep flip-flopping.</i>

285
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:23,826
But don't talk
until I tell you.

286
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,129
Okay? So whenever you're ready,
you tell me what you want.

287
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:30,132
But please don't speak
until I tell you.

288
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,434
- Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

289
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,302
Just don't speak until I say.

290
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,206
Nice to meet you...

291
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,507
So, Sal, how was that?
You're doing...

292
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:39,910
You're being a very good
horrible Santa.

293
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,545
Guys, this...
It's torture for us all.

294
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,447
It's a torture for me,
it's a torture for you,

295
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,115
it's a torture
for the children.

296
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,851
- I'm having a blast back here.
- Yeah.

297
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,752
I'm giggling with my friends.
It feels pretty good back here.

298
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,254
There's no less than 40
strands of hair in my mouth.

299
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,789
<i>Oh, it's getting
worse, Sal.</i>

300
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,727
<i>Oh!</i>

301
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:09,305
Jingle, jingle.

302
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,241
- Oh.
- I've had enough.

303
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,175
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing.

304
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:14,443
Let's get out of here.

305
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,880
- <i>That's a cut.</i>
- <i>Nice work.</i>

306
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:36,967
Where's the
Cheddar Bay Biscuits?

307
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,501
I ordered a whole another
basket, like, ten minutes ago.

308
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,070
- You already had six.
- So what?

309
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:41,837
- You're cut off.
- You can't be cut off.

310
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,706
It's unlimited, it's the
whole point of Red Lobster.

311
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:45,174
Guys. Guys.

312
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,979
- Is that Abdul?
- Kareem?

313
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,646
No. Can't be.

314
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:52,782
- That's Abdul. That's her.
- That's her.

315
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,684
- Oh, my God.
- It is Abdul.

316
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,020
I know Abdul when I see it.
It's her! I'm scared right now.

317
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,355
My windpipe is still sore
from when she hit me.

318
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,589
Yeah, she straight jacked you.

319
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:02,159
She's gonna remember
that night.

320
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:03,426
Oh, she's coming over here,
so it's curtains for us,

321
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:04,727
essentially, it's what it is.

322
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,595
- I gotta get out of here.
- No, no! Sit...

323
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:07,396
Sit down.

324
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,798
This is our Red Lobster.

325
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,332
I've been training for this
for 20 years.

326
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,601
Nobody touches you again.
Not on my watch.

327
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:14,104
- Okay, thank you.
- No, yeah.

328
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,638
- Just sit down.
- She's coming right over here.

329
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:17,239
- Act casual.
- She's looking right at us.

330
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,340
- Act casual.
- She's looking...

331
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:20,209
Smile. Act natural.

332
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,677
Smile. Smile.

333
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,547
All right.

334
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,251
Fifteen feet.

335
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:30,820
Ten feet.

336
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:31,988
Five feet.

337
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,056
Abdul.

338
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,423
You're the Impractical Jokers.

339
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,392
- Yeah.
- For real?

340
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,427
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

341
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:41,363
- Okay.
- I love you guys.

342
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,233
Oh, no joke, man.
I've watched every season.

343
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,435
Well, except for season five.

344
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:47,536
Yeah, I don't want
to get into it.

345
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,072
All right, well, thank you.

346
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,407
By any chance, you guys
gonna be in Miami next week?

347
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,375
- Yeah.
- I'm having this huge party.

348
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,311
You guys can come.
You can hang one night.

349
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,047
You can hang the weekend.
Go hang out.

350
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:58,347
- Oh, my God.
- What?

351
00:14:58,414 --> 00:14:59,715
You kidding me?

352
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,184
Yeah, we'll be there.
We were gonna go...

353
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,618
- We were going anyway.
- Yeah! Yeah!

354
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,320
Yes!

355
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,756
Sam? Hook 'em up.

356
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,496
- Season five was atrocious.
- Mmm.

357
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,331
So I'll see you in Miami?

358
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,332
Yes!
Yeah, I'll see you there.

359
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:17,934
This is crazy.

360
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,535
Yeah, that's right.
We are so in Miami.

361
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,971
- We'll see you there.
- All right.

362
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:23,305
- Miami, here we come.
- All right.

363
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:24,673
We're not really going
to Miami, are we?

364
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,841
- Of course we're going to Miami.
- No.

365
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,476
That night
was a disaster. Okay?

366
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,612
We have a chance here
for a do-over.

367
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,515
I don't need a do-over.
I'm the victim, okay?

368
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:33,950
She punched me in the throat.

369
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,818
Guys, this isn't even
a discussion, okay?

370
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,487
Abdul is here in the Lobster,
she invites us to the party,

371
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:40,056
we go to the party.

372
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:42,324
We turn back the clock.
We put that disaster to bed.

373
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh, yeah.
We're going, and this time,

374
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:45,962
we're gonna prove that
we're not gonna screw it up.

375
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,964
That's right.
With a little bit of hype.

376
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,532
- Mmm.
- No hype.

377
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,201
- A little bit.
- Mmm. No.

378
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:52,468
All right,
the appropriate amount.

379
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,937
Hmm, no. Less.

380
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:56,039
Do this. That.

381
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,307
Oh, I'm bringing this much,
and if we use it, we use it.

382
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,409
Oh, my God, there's only three.

383
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:01,677
There's only three laminates.

384
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,445
Perfect. I'm out. God's plan.

385
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:04,915
No, no, no.
What are you talking about?

386
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:07,349
We'll settle this the way
we do every big decision

387
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,985
in our life, okay?

388
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,619
The four of us will compete
in hidden camera challenges

389
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,022
on the way down to Miami,

390
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,490
and the loser does not
go to that party.

391
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,129
- Road trip, guys!
- Let's do it.

392
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:20,329
Let's just get in the car
and do it.

393
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,564
- Road trip, baby.
- Yeah!

394
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,233
Guys, I have the perfect car.

395
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,035
- You guys are gonna love this.
- Oh, thank God, yes.

396
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,703
Every part of my body
is rejecting this plan.

397
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,838
Who pays the bill, by the way?

398
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,208
I pay the bill? I pay the bill?

399
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,619
Huh?

400
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,089
- Shotgun.
- What? No!

401
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,690
Yeah, I saw it, and I said it.

402
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,025
- That's not even right.
- Yeah, that's the rule.

403
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,426
I get carsick.
I can't sit back there.

404
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:51,694
Your carsick is not my problem.

405
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,963
- No.
- Will you guys...

406
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,064
Please, please,
can you veto this?

407
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,165
I will vomit everywhere.

408
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,398
Veto it? Why would I veto that?

409
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:57,833
It's the rules of shotgun.

410
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:59,535
You see the car, you say,
"Shotgun," you sit there.

411
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,370
Joe gets shotgun
'cause he respects the leather.

412
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,538
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey, what...

413
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,107
Whatever gave you
the impression

414
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,808
- I didn't respect it?
- You scuffed the leather, man.

415
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,644
That's like punching
Grandma Lucia in her face.

416
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,113
She killed herself
in the back left seat, right?

417
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,514
Why don't we all get off
our high horses here?

418
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:13,782
All right, it's not
that great of a car.

419
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,517
- It's not a Corvette.
- No, I know.

420
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,120
It's a Crown Vic.
I know what this car is.

421
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:18,955
I mean, it's the vehicular
equivalent of Baltic Avenue.

422
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,056
Baltic Avenue?

423
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,657
What are you,
going Monopoly on me?

424
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,692
You're the thimble.
Yeah, and do not pass go.

425
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,761
You go directly
to the back seat, buddy.

426
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,830
I feel like
I'm being sandbagged.

427
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:29,698
Question, should I take
a quick shit here or should I...

428
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,634
- Would you guys just get in the car already?
- Okay.

- I think I have one.

00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,093
- What's up, bro?
- Welcome.

452
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,461
- Grizzly Adams.
- Oh, we should play Megaballs.

453
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,364
- Who?
- Oh, you got that Megaballs?

454
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:35,899
What?

455
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:38,234
Talk to me about your
collection of jazz, smooth.

456
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:40,070
I don't know, man,
there's, like, two aisles.

457
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,538
- Which one?
- Dude, I just work here.

458
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,974
That's why I'm asking you.

459
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:46,910
- Oh.
- Ooh.

460
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,114
- Let me ask you guys something.
- Hmm?

461
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,949
You guys ever wonder
what Murray gets up to

462
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:55,018
- when we're not with him?
- I would love to know.

463
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,552
We've been friends with him
my whole life.

464
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,221
I go to sleep
wondering what he does.

465
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,156
- Hmm.
- I got ideas.

466
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,291
- Yeah?
- Tell me.

467
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:02,624
- He traveled a lot.
- Yeah.

468
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:04,526
That time he went
on that tour with Yanni

469
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:06,162
in South America.

470
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,763
The Rainbows to Rainforest
Tour, I remember that.

471
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,366
Yeah, but he kept
using air quotes with that.

472
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:10,733
- He did that with you?
- Yeah,

473
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,103
like, "If you need me,
I'll be with Yanni

474
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,437
in South America."

475
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:15,838
Now, what does that mean?

476
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,041
Every part of that sentence
is a fallacy?

477
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,609
"I-I'll be unavailable."

478
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,911
- Whoa.
- What is that?

479
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,480
It's air quotes.
We're all doing it.

480
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:24,948
- No, no, no. What's that?
- Unavailable. It's air quotes.

481
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,449
You're not calling
four people over,

482
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:27,516
you gotta flip that
and reverse it.

483
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,751
Oh, all right, Missy Elliott.

484
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,053
- I wasn't sure. Got it.
- Fellas?

485
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,520
- Yo?
- Got it.

486
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,959
Right? For the road.
For the road?

487
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,027
Right?

488
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,762
I don't need him.

489
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,178
DC, baby.

490
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,315
<i>So today,
we're stopping people</i>

491
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:00,783
<i>and telling them
we gotta speak at a memorial.</i>

492
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:02,651
The only thing is that
we've written...

493
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,187
- Each other's.
- Each other's eulogies.

494
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:05,687
So, at the end,
we'll have to ask them,

495
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:07,190
"Do you think it's fit to say?"

496
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:10,193
And if they say no, we lose.
If they say yes, we win.

497
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,062
It's a sad day.

498
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,900
This just shows you
how fleeting life is, guys.

499
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,101
<i>How about this old guy?</i>

500
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,636
You got the right idea.

501
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,539
- Ooh, too many steps.
- Can't handle it.

502
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:24,074
You just, you guys
are in town just visiting

503
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,774
- for the tours, the sights?
- Yeah.

504
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,210
<i>Look at the urn.</i>

505
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:28,912
I'm in town, unfortunately,
for sad reasons.

506
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,712
- Got a, um...
- Bucket of ashes right here.

507
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,248
- I'm giving the eulogy.
- Oh.

508
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,749
Yeah, at a funeral.

509
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,717
He got a great mark.
This guy's so into the idea.

510
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,121
We're doing the thing by the water
and spreading the ashes, you know.

511
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,522
Oh, yeah.

512
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,357
.,<It's kinda why people come
to the reflection pools.

513
00:20:41,424 --> 00:20:43,026
Is that why people come
to the reflection pool, though?

514
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:44,726
I'm pretty sure you're not
allowed to even do that.

515
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:45,962
Can I run the eulogy by you?
It takes one second.

516
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:47,163
It's only
a couple sentences long.

517
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,332
You're very brave
for doing that.

518
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:50,699
Here's the eulogy I wrote.

519
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,502
"Grandma."

520
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:53,802
"Grandma was...

521
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,704
Grandma was
a straight up bitch."

522
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,876
"You know it, Grandpa.
We all know it.

523
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:01,144
And now she's dead

524
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,046
and we've got
her goddamn money.

525
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:04,813
Let's go to China Buffet
to celebrate

526
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,449
this bitch's
one-way ticket to hell."

527
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,749
Wow.

528
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:08,952
What do you think?
Is it ready to go?

529
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,956
I don't know what other
people would think about that.

530
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,524
We all felt this way
about Grandma.

531
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,558
- Oh.
- We all did.

532
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,260
Including Grandpa.

533
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:18,561
So you think I should just read
this or should I change it?

534
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:19,996
I don't... I wouldn't.

535
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,264
- You wouldn't read it?
- No.

536
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,566
Oh!

537
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:24,567
I'm not good
with public speaking.

538
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:25,734
Forget the urn. Walk away.

539
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,103
All right.
Well, take care, sir.

540
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,837
- Have a great vacation. Enjoy.
- Yeah.

541
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:30,507
- Take care, now.
- You bet.

542
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:31,574
What do you want with this?

543
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:35,811
Sir?

544
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:48,158
Guys, can I ask you a question?

545
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,259
Here we go.

546
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:50,894
It's just a few words.
I'm very nervous.

547
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,562
Can I read it to you
just to say it out loud

548
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:54,097
- and tell me if you like it?
- Sure.

549
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:55,731
I'm so nervous.
The family's meeting me. Yeah.

550
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:58,535
Okay, uh,
"Thank you all for coming

551
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,871
to the spreading of the ashes
of Joey Dumps."

552
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:03,206
- Joey Dumps.
- Joey Dumps.

553
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:04,974
"What could be said
about Joey Dumps?

554
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,509
He took his lumps."

555
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,546
"Joey Dumps was there for me.

556
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:11,147
He let me see those dumps.

557
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,049
Dumps-da-dumps-dumps-dumps."

558
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:14,284
"When you were down
in the dumps,

559
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,019
who was there for you...
Joey Dumps.

560
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,487
Dumps like a truck,
truck, truck."

561
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,924
"Guys like a what, what, what.

562
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,661
So to honor his last wish,
we now dump Dumps' ashes,

563
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,529
and then go listen
to the final episode

564
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,364
of his baseball-themed
podcast,

565
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,434
'Joey Dumps Humps Chump Umps
in the Rumps.'"

566
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,939
- <i>It's so Joey Dumps.</i>
- It's very Joey Dumps.

567
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,706
- Do you think it...
- It's very funny.

568
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,876
- Should I change anything?
- No.

569
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,444
- No? Ah.
- Oh!

570
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:43,845
- It's a great memorial.
- Thank you very much.

571
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,682
- I appreciate you guys.
- Thank you. Good luck.

572
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:47,550
- Thank you.
- He was a big Sisqó fan.

573
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,985
Wow. Ready to go.

574
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:51,588
- Good job with that, Sal.
- Sal with a W.

575
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:52,821
My eulogy game, I crush.

576
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:54,023
I give a good eulogy.

577
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:58,561
You guys ready?

578
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,163
<i>Yeah, the cameras
aren't on, but...</i>

579
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,297
How we doing?
Cameras aren't ready yet?

580
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:02,932
Guys, the secret is to...

581
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,537
pique interest,
pique the curiosity of people.

582
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,606
Could you just hold this up,
and I'm just gonna...

583
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:11,341
Yeah, just hold that up,
yeah, like that, it's perfect.

584
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:14,877
They're holding ashes.

585
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,179
There we go. That's great.

586
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:17,779
- Yeah, I'm here for a memorial.
- Oh.

587
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:21,017
So I'm about to give
a eulogy, um, about this.

588
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,685
So I'm just getting prepared.

589
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:24,387
You mind if I just say it out
loud to you guys real quick?

590
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:26,489
- Sure. Go on.
- Yeah. Hold her. Thanks.

591
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,657
<i>Okay.</i>

592
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:28,691
Sometimes he makes it
look easy.

593
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:30,792
"This that eulogy. You know.

594
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,695
You know what it is,
gang, gang.

595
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,731
Devin died. He got got."

596
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:37,467
"He got shot. He loved life.

597
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,901
He loved wife, my wife.

598
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,204
I shot that mother.
Eleven shots in the leg."

599
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,905
- In the leg?
- "I ain't supposed to be here,

600
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:44,741
but y'all know what?
Y'all can scratch.

601
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,609
I came here
to see him put down

602
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:47,710
- and piss on the grave."
- Oh!

603
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:52,415
That's when I would take...
Expose myself and start peeing.

604
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,150
- "Expose myself and..."
- And then remember

605
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,085
to drink a lot of water prior,
as a note to myself.

606
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:58,621
And then escape out
the southeast exit...

607
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,023
- <i>Escape.</i>
- Of the cemetery.

608
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:01,457
And it's a right on red.

609
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:03,960
<i>So that's how I would do that.</i>

610
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,862
- Way too extreme.
- Is it too extreme?

611
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:08,398
Oh!

612
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:09,632
Yes!

613
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,100
I should probably just say
he was a good guy.

614
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,602
Yeah, just probably...
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:13,703
I think that's all.
That's why you're MC, yeah.

616
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,836
So not good to go, then.

617
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:24,013
<i>Here goes Q. He looks good.
He's all cleaned up.</i>

618
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,415
- <i>Q always looks good.</i>
- Take a picture?

619
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:28,851
- Yeah, no problem.
- Here you go, Q, you're in.

620
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:30,453
Got it. There you go.
Thank you.

621
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,423
Thanks, I'm, uh, doing
a eulogy, actually.

622
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,824
We're supposed to dump
the ashes in here,

623
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,293
but it turns out
you're not allowed to.

624
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,795
Do you mind if I run
the speech by you?

625
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:40,797
'Cause I'm super nervous.
It's super short.

626
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:42,965
"What to say
about Cousin Frieda?

627
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,368
Sure, she had loose morals

628
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:48,004
and a libido that wouldn't
quit, and that's..."

629
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:49,872
- How old are you?
- 13.

630
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,075
13? All right, cool.

631
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,711
I'm good.

632
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:57,046
That's it. You're out.

633
00:24:57,113 --> 00:25:00,249
It's all about how she died
'cause of STDs.

634
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,296
- Gettin' up.
- Ready to go.

635
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:26,909
- Can you guys humor me?
- Always.

636
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:29,712
Can we find a cave?

637
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,216
Don't ask.

638
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,551
- Wait, it depends, for who.
- You.

639
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:42,225
This, I mean, this idea
basically was a layup for us.

640
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,026
Just how do we make
Joe's stupid face

641
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,294
look even more stupid?

642
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:48,831
The conceit here
is Joe lost his tour

643
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:50,800
about three decades ago.

644
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:53,336
And he's been living
under the earth ever since.

645
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,239
Middle of the summer,
when it's 110 degrees outside,

646
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,107
this is the place to be,
I'll tell you that.

647
00:25:58,174 --> 00:25:59,976
When you guys see Joe
for the first time,

648
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,544
that's the first time
we're seeing Joe.

649
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:02,779
I can't wait for this.

650
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:03,881
So as we're coming
through here,

651
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,281
kind of look along the ceiling.

652
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:07,049
We got lots
of these little divots.

653
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:09,018
Here we go.

654
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,586
You'll notice these cracks.

655
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,456
That's the water movement
when all this was underwater.

656
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:14,657
Hello?

657
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:16,225
- Oh.
- Oh.

658
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:19,195
- Yo.
- Oh, hey, man.

659
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:20,596
Oh.

660
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:24,033
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What's up?

661
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:28,337
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

662
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:32,742
<i>Look at their faces.
They're shocked.</i>

663
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:35,011
Oh, my God. For real, though?

664
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:36,779
That's freakin' me out.

665
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:37,980
It's freakin' you out?

666
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:39,215
Imagine what this is like
for me.

667
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:40,483
You all right, dude?

668
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,717
No, I've been
to too many movies.

669
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:42,853
Oh, he's gross.

670
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,888
I got lost
a little while ago.

671
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:46,155
Hey.

672
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:47,457
I didn't think he was...
I didn't think

673
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,058
he was gonna come out
of this cave.

674
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,694
I was waiting for my parents.

675
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:53,396
I've been down here since 1987.

676
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,632
Dad said,
"Don't have a cow, man.

677
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,733
Talk to the hand."

678
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,069
And I was here...

679
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:01,637
I got all turned around.

680
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,106
What happened was I was looking
for the gift shop...

681
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,442
It's on down the left.

682
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,012
I went on my ass
to the left here...

683
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,380
I like your shirt.

684
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,483
I'm the beef.

685
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,751
Joe, be proud
of your "I'm the Beef" shirt.

686
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:17,855
- Back of...
- I'm the beef.

687
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:20,256
<i>I'm the beef.</i>

688
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:21,491
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

689
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,159
- I'll just fold in.
- Oh, okay.

690
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,228
Well, the water...

691
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:26,796
Again, the water
that moves through it,

692
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:28,531
that just opens up the cave.

693
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:30,800
So this water,
usually, with the rain,

694
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,034
<i>will come up over that way.</i>

695
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,269
Y'all have any questions?

696
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:34,303
I have...
I have a lot of questions.

697
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,506
Uh, yeah. Go ahead.

698
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,808
Let's start
with what year is it?

699
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,344
- It's 2018, sir.
- Okay.

700
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,514
Let me check my pager.

701
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,984
Joe, have them fall in line
and walk in front of them

702
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:48,484
- like you're a sergeant.
- Why don't you...

703
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,286
Why don't you let me
just tell everybody?

704
00:27:50,353 --> 00:27:51,454
- <i>You're pissed at everybody.</i>
- This water comes every...

705
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:52,788
Come on, Neil.

706
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,424
This is what happened.

707
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:57,093
You go up this ravine
and it's a dead end.

708
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,796
- Goes up, like, 200 feet.
- 350 feet, Neil.

709
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:03,332
Goes to 350 feet, okay?

710
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,600
I mean, if you're gonna
talk out your ass,

711
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,102
turn around
so I can understand you.

712
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,407
<i>Anybody know who shot J.R.?</i>

713
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:13,109
Do you guys know who shot J.R.?

714
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:17,747
'Cause I missed...
J.R. from <i>Dallas.</i>

715
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:18,982
I missed that.

716
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,750
It's been on my mind
for so long.

717
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:23,819
- Dad?
- Dad? What?

718
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:25,821
I didn't say shit.

719
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,027
You guys,
follow me out of here.

720
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,227
I'm dying to get outside.

721
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,528
Did Mondale get a second term?

722
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,430
Did Mondale get a second term?

723
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,403
Uh, okay, we're still
rolling here, guys.

724
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:44,707
You fucking son of a bitch.
Oh, my God.

725
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:47,143
Oh, my God.
It scared the shit out of me.

726
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,711
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

727
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:59,121
Turn up the tension.
Pedal, pedal.

728
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:00,489
- Hey, bud, what's up?
- Hey.

729
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:04,226
You, uh, have
a laptop charger or...

730
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:05,661
Which one?
USB-C or the older ones?

731
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:08,564
Let's go, ladies!
Keep it going!

732
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:11,133
Work the quads,
work the glutes.

733
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,468
Anyways, what can I do
for you, bud?

734
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:14,337
- "Let's go, ladies"?
- Let's go, yeah.

735
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:15,906
Who are these ladies?

736
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:18,240
Do me a favor, keep 'em
encouraged while I'm gone.

737
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,712
Let's go!

738
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:25,048
You are doggin' it!
I want to see more out of you!

739
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,382
You over there,
you're looking good.

740
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:28,085
- Let's go!
- Sorry, that's too much.

741
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,518
- That's too much.
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

742
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:30,854
I don't have the USB-C,
I have the older laptop,

743
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,022
so I don't got it, bud.

744
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,489
Good?

745
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:34,958
- Did you...
- I haven't got it, okay?

746
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:38,160
Come on, ladies!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

747
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:55,344
<i>Q is on a boat
with a couple of strangers,</i>

748
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:57,413
<i>and we've arranged
for this boat to pull up</i>

749
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,882
<i>on someone in distress.</i>

750
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:01,684
Q doesn't know who, how,
or what the situation is.

751
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:03,753
<i>In that moment,
the captain's gonna say,</i>

752
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,956
<i>because of the law,
he cannot accept</i>

753
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:07,256
anyone else on the boat

754
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:08,892
unless it's unanimously
agreed upon.

755
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,726
<i>The catch is that we're
gonna give him the reason</i>

756
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:12,328
<i>why this guy
can't get on the boat.</i>

757
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:14,664
You see that?

758
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,366
Guy over there
flagging us down.

759
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,435
- A guy?
- <i>Uh-oh, Q. Uh-oh, Q.</i>

760
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:20,670
Somebody's in the water.

761
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:25,042
<i>You see who that is, Q?</i>

762
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:28,611
<i>Is that a U.S. soldier?</i>

763
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:30,680
- <i>A hero?</i>
- <i>An American hero.</i>

764
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,150
It's G.I. Float.

765
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:35,718
I'm a U.S. soldier in distress.

766
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:36,887
Can you please help?

767
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,088
We have to make sure
that everyone's okay

768
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,321
with bringing him on.

769
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:40,322
Are you guys
all right with that?

770
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:41,724
Yeah, that's all right.

771
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,325
You're okay
with bringing him on?

772
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:46,963
If he's in distress,
then we want to help.

773
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,364
You okay to bring him on?

774
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,799
Well, hear me out.

775
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:51,434
I mean, we help a solider
in a dinghy,

776
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,335
what's that gonna do
for his confidence?

777
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,571
If we...

778
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:57,606
If we were to help
a soldier in a dinghy,

779
00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:59,575
what's that do
for his confidence?

780
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:04,147
We have backed him
into a corner like no other.

781
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:06,315
- Where's he from?
- Where did you serve?

782
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:09,052
- Iraq.
- Oh, so he survived Iraq.

783
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,486
He's okay.

784
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:13,090
I thank you for your service.

785
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:15,825
I'm just saying, we don't really
know anything about the guy.

786
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:17,928
They sell that outfit
at any Army-Navy store.

787
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:20,463
You know?

788
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:21,898
How is this even an issue?

789
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,703
I know this looks like
I don't want

790
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,206
to save a U.S. soldier
in distress...

791
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,007
- No, it doesn't.
- It doesn't? Great.

792
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:33,977
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Wow.

793
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:36,512
How is he convincing people
not to help a soldier?

794
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:38,915
I know, right, a unanimous
vote from you guys, seriously.

795
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,150
Yeah, we're good.

796
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,417
We talked it out,

797
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,519
and we're okay
just bailing on him.

798
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:45,088
I feel bad
leaving him out there.

799
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,555
- Yes!
- Oh.

800
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:48,959
I need an answer
from each of you, then, so...

801
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:51,128
I'll go with whatever
the group decides.

802
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:52,328
Let him on the boat.

803
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:53,562
- Yeah?
- <i>Oh!</i>

804
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:56,432
- Let him on?
- Yeah!

805
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,833
Where were you going to?

806
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,269
Uh, actually,
I was trying to get to Miami

807
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,072
to see the Paula Abdul concert.

808
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,009
Aren't we all.

809
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:13,582
<i>This looks like
a real party crowd</i>

810
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,919
you have out there, pal.

811
00:32:15,986 --> 00:32:17,820
We're about to roll up
on somebody.

812
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:20,456
<i>Here we go,
they're already worried.</i>

813
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,259
It's a man in a boat?

814
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:24,060
<i>Joe, why don't you go take
a look at who's in distress?</i>

815
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:26,328
Just watch Joe's face.

816
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,698
I'm stuck.

817
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:31,500
Can you swing around,
give me a hand?

818
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:32,701
Oh, man.

819
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:37,339
Oh, I'm stuck!

820
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:40,110
I'm having trouble
getting back on the boat.

821
00:32:40,177 --> 00:32:42,946
What does he think?

822
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:45,548
Basically, maritime law says
that if we bring him on,

823
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:47,550
everyone has to be okay
with us bringing him on.

824
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,986
- Does it have to be unanimous?
- It has to be unanimous.

825
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,420
- Is it all right with you?
- Oh, no it...

826
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:52,521
- Is it okay with you, sir?
- Yeah.

827
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,824
Oh, no.

828
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:57,359
I mean, hear me out.

829
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:58,727
I promised I'd never put myself

830
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:00,329
into this situation again.

831
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,630
I promised
I'd never put myself

832
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:02,966
in this situation again.

833
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,234
I've been burned once.

834
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:05,135
I'm not gonna let it
happen twice.

835
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,537
- You're saying no?
- I'm saying no, yeah.

836
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:10,639
Murr, I'm having issues
with my dinghy.

837
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:13,475
Guys, I'm having issues
with my dinghy.

838
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,411
I don't know which dinghy
he's talking about.

839
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:17,479
I don't know.

840
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:21,885
I mean, you gotta see it
from our point of view, pal.

841
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:23,752
Joe, go on a rant.
Take this thing over.

842
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,521
You got your buttocks out
in the middle of the ocean,

843
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,389
bobbing up and down
with a lady on the boat,

844
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,859
I mean, you want us
to take you on...

845
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,526
- I mean, where are your trunks?
- What?

846
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,863
The logic doesn't track.
Where are your trunks?

847
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,867
Can't we just help him
get on his boat?

848
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,467
<i>Joey,
it's you versus Murr.</i>

849
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,004
- He gets on, you lose.
- Dead, pal.

850
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:44,406
Yeah, the rule is we both
get on this boat, I lose.

851
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,843
- Pretty much.
- What?

852
00:33:47,911 --> 00:33:49,279
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
Hold on!

853
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:50,679
What are you doing?

854
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:53,149
<i>Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joey.</i>

855
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:54,783
What are you... What?

856
00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:57,386
I'm out. Ah!

857
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:02,325
Is this for real?

858
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:04,627
<i>He's gonna save him.
He's going to save him.</i>

859
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:07,696
- Come on!
- So Murray still loses.

860
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,199
- That's it, he's off.
- Oh, my God, Murray...

861
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:10,399
<i>Well, he's not
getting on the boat.</i>

862
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,500
- Get in...
- Just not...

863
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,769
- Oh!
- Oh!

864
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:15,604
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

865
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:18,008
How could you dare
touch that ass?

866
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:20,877
- I'll see you back at land.
- Are you kidding me? Joe!

867
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:22,444
Do you have beer on this boat?

868
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,282
Son of a...

869
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,906
- Wow. This is special.
- Ooh.

870
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:51,473
You couldn't have booked
something a little bit better?

871
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,109
It's 2 1/2 stars.
How many stars do you need?

872
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,743
- All of them.
- One of the reviews,

873
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,780
Danny D. says,
"Found two crack pipes, lolz."

874
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,317
With a Z.
Still gave it four stars.

875
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,483
- All right.
- With a Z?

876
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,953
- It's got cable.
- That's hip.

877
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,463
You guys did not think
we weren't gonna

878
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,032
mess with Sal
on this trip, did you?

879
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,001
Yeah, that's right, we stopped
at this roadside motel

880
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:19,501
because they allow pets.

881
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:21,004
You're about to see
a grown man cry.

882
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:24,773
I was saying, like, pull up
to him, so it could be fun.

883
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,508
Just... You're just going
to see what he's doing.

884
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:28,677
- Right. Hoodie's on?
- Get in.

885
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:32,949
What?

886
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:38,254
All right. Can I...

887
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:39,722
Just open the door, buddy.

888
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,858
- There's no handle.
- No handle?

889
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:43,559
This isn't the nicest motel.

890
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,128
This wasn't right for today.

891
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:47,230
Sal, everybody knows
you're afraid of cats.

892
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:58,341
Oh, my...

893
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,276
That's a tiger.

894
00:36:00,343 --> 00:36:02,678
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

895
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,848
I can't do this. Oh, my God.

896
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:08,985
How did you get the insurance
to sign off on this?

897
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:10,387
We didn't.

898
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,788
Guys, I don't think it's funny.
I don't want to do it.

899
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:15,824
Guys, please. Guys, please.
Guys, please.

900
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:17,293
I don't think it's funny, guys.

901
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,263
Oh. Can't move.

902
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,598
Yeah, that's probably wise
that you don't move.

903
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:25,035
I've seen so many movies
and so many TV shows...

904
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,569
In one second,
if this tiger wants to kill me,

905
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,571
the tiger's gonna kill me.

906
00:36:31,307 --> 00:36:33,675
Guys, did you think this
through all the way?

907
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,111
- Not really
- Not really, no.

908
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,013
How can you do this to me?
What do I do?

909
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,515
Try to get
out of the room, bud.

910
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,150
There's a door
right in front of you.

911
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,055
- Uh-oh.
- <i>Uh-oh.</i>

912
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,856
Now he's more concerned
about the lock than the tiger.

913
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:49,959
No, no, no, no, no.

914
00:36:50,026 --> 00:36:51,294
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

915
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,395
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

916
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:56,366
Guys, I can't make it.

917
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:58,034
<i>Good, he's brushing
his teeth. Go, go.</i>

918
00:36:58,101 --> 00:36:59,802
- <i>He's brushing his teeth.</i>
- <i>There he goes.</i>

919
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:00,836
- <i>He's up on the sink.</i>
- <i>Get out of there.</i>

920
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:03,239
<i>Get out of there, quick.</i>

921
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,275
Look at the poster
in front of your face.

922
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:08,211
- You think that's funny?
- <i>It's the shit.</i>

923
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:10,046
Just hang in there, pal.

924
00:37:10,113 --> 00:37:11,814
Guys, I...

925
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:15,251
don't think this is funny.

926
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,619
- Who's there?
- Just let me in, guys.

927
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:18,955
- It's not funny.
- <i>Sal, it's super easy.</i>

928
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:20,090
<i>You just have to say
this sentence.</i>

929
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,491
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- "Let me in.

930
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,725
I'm a baby bitch boy."

931
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,328
Let me in,
I'm the baby bitch boy.

932
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,364
No, no, that's what Joe
wanted you to say.

933
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:29,832
I want you to say,

934
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:33,236
"Murr's funnier, smarter,
and better than me."

935
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:35,038
Come here, buddy.
Come here, buddy.

936
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:53,356
Chaplin moustache
will never come back.

937
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:54,457
- Oh, hey, bud.
- Hey.

938
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:55,358
Do you know the Wi-Fi password?

939
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:56,692
Oh, the Wi-Fi?

940
00:37:56,758 --> 00:37:57,961
Sure, you don't have it
in your room?

941
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,896
No, the card's not in there,
so, yeah.

942
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:07,003
I mean, just search
for Morgan Suites.

943
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,571
The password is "password."

944
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:10,306
The password is "password"?
That's not very secure.

945
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,041
- No.
- Yeah. Oh, hey.

946
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:14,710
Oh, hey! It's the Houlihans.

947
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:16,845
One sec. Hey, Marisa, Chris.
Come on.

948
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:17,947
- Please, please.
- Murr!

949
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:19,681
Hey, Marisa, you look gorgeous.

950
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:20,716
- Yeah.
- And Chris.

951
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:21,851
Scotch is in the back.

952
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:23,253
- Take it easy this time.
- Always.

953
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:24,387
- All right, buddy. Good night.
- All right, man.

954
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:25,388
You have a good night.

955
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:36,966
Grover Cleveland
was a Capricorn... Yeah, man?

956
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,268
Are there any caps
on the password?

957
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:39,302
All caps.

958
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:40,802
All caps password.
Yeah, thanks.

959
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,760
Uh-huh. I guess I'm late.

960
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:07,163
What do you want to do?

961
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,830
All right, this looks nice
and cool in the sun.

962
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:09,866
This is gonna be great.

963
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:15,405
All right.

964
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:16,873
Here we go.

965
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,608
Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

966
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:22,245
Nobody told me your name,
buddy.

967
00:39:22,312 --> 00:39:24,547
So how about we go
with Benjamin Horse?

968
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,316
Yes. All right.

969
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,322
Oh.

970
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:33,789
Oh, my goodness.

971
00:39:35,325 --> 00:39:39,162
This says we go up one mile
and make a left,

972
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:42,932
and then we can punch the guys.

973
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:44,867
I'd like to marry a girl
like you one day.

974
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:47,736
Pretty. Beautiful blue eyes.

975
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,006
Calm, steady demeanor.

976
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:53,742
You guys messed up,
because I'm havin' a blast!

977
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,212
This is the best
road trip ever!

978
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:04,320
Let me ask you this,

979
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:06,556
When was the last time
you had an E.L. Fudge?

980
00:40:06,623 --> 00:40:08,258
- One week ago.
- Really?

981
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,626
- No exaggeration.
- You're lying.

982
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:11,394
I swear to God.

983
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:13,563
Fudge Stripe gets all the shine
over at Keebler.

984
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,998
Fudge Stripe's a better cookie.

985
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,832
I'm talking Keebler,
I'm talking E.L. Fudge.

986
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:18,668
I'm talking Fudge Stripe,
and then I move on.

987
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:20,103
I'll give you $1,000/

988
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,871
if any of you can tell me
what E.L. stands for.

989
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:24,840
I'm blowing your mind
right now.

990
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:28,278
Everybody loves?

991
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:31,748
- Shit.
- You carry $1,000 with you?

992
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:34,384
- I think I see someone.
- Yeah!

993
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,518
Oh, there he is.

994
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:38,655
Welcome to the party, pal.

995
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:40,056
Come on, Fatiator.

996
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:42,325
Once my balls shot directly
up in my body

997
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:45,827
about a mile back,
I started enjoying it.

998
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:47,263
- You got it. Be careful, man.
- Whoa!

999
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,733
- Park it over there.
- Okay, okay. All right.

1000
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:51,868
You good?

1001
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:58,541
You're forever
my horse, baby.

1002
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:11,721
Murr, how... This idiot.

1003
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:13,256
- What?
- Look at...

1004
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:17,260
How does he even sleep
like that?

1005
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:18,861
Oh, man.
He's got no idea what's coming.

1006
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:21,097
Oh, I know.
I've already made some calls.

All right, how are you?

1028
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,272
Well, ladies,
this is the birthday boy.

1029
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:04,407
We're here to celebrate him.

1030
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:08,578
So let's do this.

1031
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:14,817
I hold back.

1032
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:17,086
I get shy at first.

1033
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,124
I guess it is a little.

1034
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,458
It's his birthday, ladies.

1035
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:24,193

That's Murray's family

00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:54,157
That's James' nieces

I feel like they shouldn't
put an ad out for that.

1058
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:47,443
It's unclear.

- Well, welcome.
- Thank you.

1070
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:12,735
So where are you
coming in from?

1071
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:14,170
Oh, I live here in Atlanta.

1072

You answer the questions
we ask you.

<i>Where do I see myself
in five years?</i>

1075
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:22,378
Well, in five years,
I see myself well on track

1076
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:24,480
to maybe a managerial...

1077
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:25,715
Okay, great.

1078
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:27,817

about this role in particular?

<i>Well, what do you feel
your biggest strength is?</i>

My biggest strengths are...

1082
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,859
I would say confidence,
approachability...

1083
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,527
- Sure.
- I'm easy to talk with.

1084
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:39,362
Why leave your position
at Georgia State?

1085
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:40,931
I saw you were there
until March.

1086

- <i>In full disclosure...</i>
- In full disclosure...

- I had a child out of wedlock.

If that disqualifies me
from the job, I understand.

1089
00:44:50,373 --> 00:44:53,075
If that disqualifies me
from the job, I understand.

00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:59,515
I put a Polaroid camera.
Just take a quick picture.

1092
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:01,250
- Cool.
- Right?

1093
00:45:01,317 --> 00:45:02,785
- You got a...
- Yeah.

1094
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:06,622
- Camera. Nice.
- Yeah.

1095
00:45:06,689 --> 00:45:08,257
<i>Get him to sign it.
Get him to sign it.</i>

1096
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:10,459
- Well, um...
- Can you autograph?

1097
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:12,194
- Is that cool?
- Sure, yeah. Yeah, bring it.

1098
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:13,529
<i>I mean,
you are on the Hawks.</i>

1099
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:15,032
I mean,
you are on the Hawks, so...

1100
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:16,666
Yeah, well... Yeah.

1101
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:18,568
I have to apologize
if I seem a little off.

1102
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,202
I have to apologize,
by the way,

1103
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:21,905
if I seem a little off
during the interview.

1104
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:23,105
Aunt Flo's in town.

1105
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:25,408
Aunt...

1106
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:27,310
Frick.

1107
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:28,711
Looks like I'm not
getting the job.

1108
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:32,950
- <i>Or the party ticket.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1109
00:45:36,218 --> 00:45:37,620
<i>Look at this, boys.</i>

1110
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:38,989
<i>This is big-time...
You get this job,</i>

1111
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:40,389
you're gonna be
big-time, buddy.

1112
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:41,524
This is a big-time gig
we're infiltrating.

1113
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:43,659
I'm ready for the big time.

1114
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:45,595
- <i>Here she comes.</i>
- Hello, hi.

1115
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,430
- How are you?
- How are you? I'm Brian.

1116
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:50,199
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

1117
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:51,233
<i>Here we go.</i>

1118
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,735
- Oh.
- Here we go, Q.

1119
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:54,804
You've seen
the job description.

1120
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:56,339
- I have. Yeah.
- Correct?

1121
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,641
- I got it right here.
- Two words, under qualified.

1122
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:01,477
Two words, under qualified,
but willing to learn.

1123
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:03,512
Willing to learn. That's great.

1124
00:46:04,814 --> 00:46:07,450
Can you describe
your style of management?

1125
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:09,086
- My style of management?
- Mmm-hmm.

1126
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,453
Sure, well,
my nickname's Crab Cake,

1127
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:11,955
so if that's any indication...

1128
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,357
My nickname... All my, uh...

1129
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:16,258
All my workers
call me Crab Cakes,

1130
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:17,760
if that's any indication.

1131
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:18,962
- Yeah.
- Really?

1132
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,030
- Yeah, Crab Cakes.
- Yeah.

1133
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:23,199
If the guys want
to call me Crab Cakes,

1134
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:26,069
hey, call me Crab Cakes.

1135
00:46:26,135 --> 00:46:27,570
- <i>Off topic...</i>
- Off topic...

1136
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:29,906
Is that stupid mascot
of yours a woodpecker?

1137
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:31,273
What is that thing?

1138
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,243
Is that...
That stupid mascot you have,

1139
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,946
is that a woodpecker,
what is that thing?

1140
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:39,281
- I can't even look.
- Oh, my God.

1141
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:41,450
- I can't even look.
- <i>It's a hawk.</i>

1142
00:46:41,517 --> 00:46:42,752
I don't know
what you call that bird.

1143
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:44,353
Yeah? Oh, it looks
like a woodpecker.

1144
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:49,792
Yeah.

1145
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,494
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

1146
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,796
Will I be pissing in a cup
for a drug test?

1147
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:56,599
Do you know, is, um...

1148
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:03,272
He doesn't want to say it.

1149
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:05,207
Yeah, I really tanked this one.

1150
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:07,176
There's no way
I'm going to see Abdul.

1151
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:10,013
There's no way I'm going
to see Paula Abdul.

1152
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:13,950
Explain the plot of the movie.

1153
00:47:14,017 --> 00:47:15,418
We're four high school friends.

1154
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,954
So we're on a road trip
for redemption

1155
00:47:18,021 --> 00:47:20,489
for an incident that happened
back in 1990,

1156
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:22,025
like, coming back
to haunt us now.

1157
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:24,161
And there's only three tickets
to see Abdul,

1158
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:26,629
and one of us can't go.

1159
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:28,831
- Rate our movie.
- The movie's 3 1/2 stars.

1160
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:30,633
The movie's gonna be
3 1/2 stars.

1161
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:33,469
This interview is bullshit.

1162
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:38,207
This interview is bullshit.

1163
00:47:41,078 --> 00:47:43,446
Thank you.

1164
00:47:43,512 --> 00:47:45,214
It's total bullshit.

1165
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:49,218
It's all for a movie.

1166
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:52,989
<i>Hey, buddy,
everything look cozy?</i>

1167
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:54,858
Yep.
What's that?

1168
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:56,692
<i>That's Chase, you met him
at a Big Brother program.</i>

1169
00:47:56,759 --> 00:47:58,561
Then you lost him, and now
he's your guardian angel

1170
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:00,964
that looks over you
during all the big events,

1171
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:02,231
including job interviews.

1172
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:03,632
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, yeah, yeah.

1173
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:05,835
How are you?
Very random.

1174
00:48:05,902 --> 00:48:08,838
- That's actually Chase.
- Okay. Great.

1175
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:10,040
He was my Little Brother,

1176
00:48:10,107 --> 00:48:11,141
in the Little Brother,
Big Brother program.

1177
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,508
Okay.

1178
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:13,910
He's like my guardian angel,
inspiration.

1179
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:15,444
He's gonna look over
the interview for me.

1180
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:16,812
- Oh, I think that's great.
- Thank you.

1181
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,447
I was like, did someone
leave anything?

1182
00:48:18,514 --> 00:48:19,515
- Oh, no, what is your name?
- Brandy. Brandy.

1183
00:48:19,582 --> 00:48:20,616
- Brandy.
- Yeah, sorry.

1184
00:48:20,683 --> 00:48:22,085
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Sal.

1185
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,186
Immediately launch into
why the Earth is flat.

1186
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,521
I like talking to people

1187
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:26,857
about all different types
of things.

1188
00:48:26,923 --> 00:48:28,257
- Right.
- You know, for example, like,

1189
00:48:28,324 --> 00:48:30,326
no denying it for me that the,

1190
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:32,095
you know, I believe
the Earth is flat.

1191
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:33,997
So I like to talk about that.

1192
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:35,264
Okay. Great.

1193
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:38,567
How do you feel
about the shape of the Earth?

1194
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:41,637
What is your opinion
on the shape of the Earth?

1195
00:48:41,704 --> 00:48:43,305
- Um...
- <i>There's the look.</i>

1196
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:47,210
I mean, I'm pretty literal,
so I'm gonna go with round.

1197
00:48:47,276 --> 00:48:48,677
Yeah, most people
think it's round.

1198
00:48:48,744 --> 00:48:50,646
- Yeah.
- But they'd be wrong.

1199
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:54,383
They told me to bring
a recommendation,

1200
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,952
- so I brought one.
- They said to bring a rec...

1201
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:59,222
A recommendation too, and
I also have a recommendation.

1202
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:00,790
Sal, pull out the iPad there.

1203
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:02,324
Uh, so here.

1204
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:06,863
<i>It's Sal's mom, Adele.</i>

1205
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:11,700
Please hire him.
He'd be a good employee.

1206
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:14,303
He doesn't steal.
He's a good boy.

1207
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,639
<i>He pays me to clean his house,</i>

1208
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:18,307
<i>so please, please,
please hire him</i>

1209
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:20,110
<i>so he can keep paying me.</i>

1210
00:49:21,777 --> 00:49:24,047
<i>Oh, my God.
That's awesome.</i>

1211
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,117
- You good?
- Ah, hell, nah!

1212
00:49:27,184 --> 00:49:30,153
Instead of "Oh, hell, no,"
do the singing version of it.

1213
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,353
<i>♪ Hell, no ♪</i>

1214
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,722
<i>♪ To the no, no, no ♪</i>

1215
00:49:35,391 --> 00:49:38,394
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1216
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,362
- What are you writing?
- What, what are you...

1217
00:49:40,429 --> 00:49:41,564
What are you writing?

1218
00:49:43,432 --> 00:49:45,035
- My notes.
- Oh, great. Perfect.

1219
00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:48,771
Take notes.

1220
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:50,773
<i>Yeah, Sal,
take notes on her.</i>

1221
00:49:56,512 --> 00:49:59,415
Sal, just go, "Are there
one T or two in 'pretty'?"

1222
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:03,752
Ah, done!

1223
00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:06,990
- Done, boys.
- Well done.

1224
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:10,927
Okay, so this is my outfit.

1225
00:50:10,994 --> 00:50:14,197
<i>Yeah, Joey in a breakaway
basketball warmup suit.</i>

1226
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:15,497
So as soon as the person
comes in,

1227
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:17,566
you just get ready
for game time.

1228
00:50:19,735 --> 00:50:21,238
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

1229
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:22,705
- <i>Big hug.</i>
- Nice to see you.

1230
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,573
- Emily. Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

1231
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,742
- Yeah, I'm ready to do this.
- Oh, here you go.

1232
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:28,945
- That's amazing.
- Right?

1233
00:50:29,012 --> 00:50:30,046
That is awesome.

1234
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:33,382
So nice to meet you.
I'm Emily.

1235
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:34,817
I'm the building
security manager.

1236
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:36,319
- Building security manager?
- Yes, sir, so...

1237
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:37,320
And what was your name again?
I'm sorry.

1238
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:39,022
Emily. Yes, sir.

1239
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:41,091
I'm gonna let you get started
other than that amazing intro.

1240
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:42,758
- Oh, thank you.
- Joe, where are you from?

1241
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:44,127
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

1242
00:50:44,194 --> 00:50:45,362
Nah, nah.

1243
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:47,429
Nah, I didn't want to...

1244
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:48,797
I didn't really want
to get into that.

1245
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:52,369
What's that?
Which part.

1246
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:54,570
My past.
My shadowy past.

1247
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:56,940
My shadowy past.
I didn't really want to start...

1248
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:00,277
Keep saying "off the record."

1249
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:01,677
- Off the record...
- Mmm-hmm.

1250
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:03,914
I negotiated prices
for, like, bulk supplies.

1251
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,547
- Mmm-hmm.
- I would let them in

1252
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:07,083
on the, to the side.

1253
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,952
Joe, she's writing this down.
It's off the record.

1254
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:10,719
Yeah,
but this is all off the...

1255
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:12,389
- This is all off the record.
- No, no, you're fine.

1256
00:51:12,454 --> 00:51:13,522
I'm just talking about your
extension of knowledge with...

1257
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:14,958
Got it, got it.

1258
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:16,393
Um, what else can I tell you
off the record?

1259
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:18,194
Joe, have a roving finger.

1260
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:20,096
There was one time
when a whole crew was in here,

1261
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:21,898
and they had to actually be on
the other side of the campus,

1262
00:51:21,965 --> 00:51:23,867
but the middle was closed,
so I couldn't get them through.

1263
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:25,434
We had to actually
go around the whole thing.

1264
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:26,669
- But off the record.
- Off the record, Monica.

1265
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:27,569
Off the record,
we went through

1266
00:51:27,636 --> 00:51:28,872
the closed road, Monica.

1267
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:30,506
<i>Here comes
the moving finger.</i>

1268
00:51:30,572 --> 00:51:31,740
And, you know, there was
a lot of teams up here,

1269
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:32,876
and then
we brought it down south.

1270
00:51:32,943 --> 00:51:34,610
You know,
you connect everybody,

1271
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:36,612
and they all have their
own conferences and stuff,

1272
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:38,281
but, uh, I have stopped...

1273
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:40,649
Excuse yourself for one quick
moment to go to the bathroom

1274
00:51:40,716 --> 00:51:42,518
and then go downstairs
and play basketball.

1275
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:44,820
Um, I need to use
the restroom real quick.

1276
00:51:44,888 --> 00:51:46,256
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, sure, no worries.

1277
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:47,991
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

1278
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,093
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry.

1279
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,760
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks.

1280
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,899
<i>Look at her face!</i>

1281
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:03,639
- <i>This is gonna be amazing.</i>
- <i>Her face is...</i>

1282
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:16,886
Almost.

1283
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:19,189
Joey, uh, security
really sucks around here.

1284
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:22,959
- You good?
- Yeah, security really sucks.

1285
00:52:23,026 --> 00:52:25,061
I was able just to go down
there and shoot hoops.

1286
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:33,602
- Yeah.
- So security's an issue.

1287
00:52:34,137 --> 00:52:35,038
Yeah.

1288
00:52:35,105 --> 00:52:37,273
Security's an issue.

1289
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,210
All right, well, do you have
any further questions for me?

1290
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:42,778
Tell her you'll be in touch
and she did great.

1291
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:44,014
And, uh, that's it.
Yeah, thank you so much.

1292
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,749
You did great.
We'll be in touch.

1293
00:52:46,815 --> 00:52:48,151
I'll get Jakim to, uh...

1294
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:50,586
Hey, appreciate it.
Yeah, we'll let you know.

1295
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:53,423
Possibly.
Maybe we'll hire her.

1296
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:56,426
Maybe we'll hire her.

1297
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:57,360
I'm not sure
if we'll hire her.

1298
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,101
- <i>A left right here?</i>
- <i>Go.</i>

1299
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:07,103
<i>Yeah, baby, yeah!</i>

1300
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,571
<i>Disgusting loading dock.
Nice, guys.</i>

1301
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,879
Now do you want to tell me
why we're here?

1302
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:17,247
We're just gonna pop into

1303
00:53:17,313 --> 00:53:18,714
this social media convention
real quick.

1304
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:20,849
- Uh-huh.
- Here's your credentials.

1305
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,452
We're having fun with you today
at your expense.

1306
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:24,921
Hey, bud, uh, you're, uh...
You're on in ten minutes.

1307
00:53:26,222 --> 00:53:28,324
You're terrible
at social networking, so...

1308
00:53:32,228 --> 00:53:33,329
Give it up one more time

1309
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:35,065
for your When Brands
Take a Stand panel.

1310
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,302
<i>So we are at
the Social Shake-Up,</i>

1311
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:42,738
<i>which is a tremendous
social media conference here,</i>

1312
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:45,075
and Q is about to go up
and give a presentation.

1313
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:46,708
- Yeah.
- We wrote the presentation.

1314
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:48,644
He's never seen a single
one of these slides.

1315
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,080
<i>There's 600 people here,</i>

1316
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:52,048
which is a little more
than we usually have.

1317
00:53:52,115 --> 00:53:53,283
A little more?

1318
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:57,087
We do have a last-minute
addition to the roster.

1319
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:59,856
<i>We have a new speaker
coming up.</i>

1320
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:01,757
We have been trying
to do this for years.

1321
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:04,994
Please welcome to the stage
Peter Foaks.

1322
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:07,629
Peter Foaks.

1323
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:13,802
Good morning, everybody.

1324
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,704
Very excited to be here.
Thank you for having me.

1325
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:16,973
My name is Peter Foaks.

1326
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,541
They brought me here
'cause I'm...

1327
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,977
really been doing well
as a social media influencer,

1328
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:23,745
so why don't we get started.

1329
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:26,682
How to Become
a Social Media Influencer,

1330
00:54:26,748 --> 00:54:29,718
or as my dad calls it,
"not have a real job."

1331
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,957
So here we go.

1332
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:36,192
His world after this
is gonna change.

1333
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:38,461
We may not be friends
after this moment.

1334
00:54:38,528 --> 00:54:40,063
I recently interviewed

1335
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,965
social media influencer
Franz Goldberg.

1336
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:44,100
Do you guys know who that is?

1337
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:45,969
Ah, you're gonna love this.
Okay.

1338
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,703
<i>Hi, my name
is Franz Goldberg,</i>

1339
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:50,039
<i>and I'm what you would call
a social media influencer.</i>

1340
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:52,208
<i>My major platform is YouTube.</i>

1341
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:54,010
<i>Advertisers want to...</i>

1342
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:56,312
<i>...and I can provide them...</i>

1343
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:58,448
<i>It's interrupting.</i>

1344
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:03,553
Did somebody call a plumber?

1345
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,688
Yes.
I need my pipes cleaned.

1346
00:55:09,993 --> 00:55:11,727
That's Q's parents!

1347
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:13,196
That's Q's real parents.

1348
00:55:13,263 --> 00:55:16,533
- I can help with that.
- Oh, goody.

1349
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:17,567
Come this way.

1350
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:18,667
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1351
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:20,436
<i>Good pipes.
Oh.</i>

1352
00:55:20,503 --> 00:55:22,438
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1353
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:24,840
<i>...place them
at the end of my video.</i>

1354
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:27,210
<i>I like to place them inside...</i>

1355
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:36,519
I must have recorded
over an old tape on that one.

1356
00:55:39,656 --> 00:55:41,224
Also, um...

1357
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:44,394
you probably shouldn't use
tapes in the modern era,

1358
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,596
'cause of accidents like that.

1359
00:55:46,663 --> 00:55:48,932
You know, digital...
digital...

1360
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:51,201
I would say digital
is the way to go.

1361
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:53,570
He can't even speak.

1362
00:55:53,636 --> 00:55:55,804
His mind is blown.

1363
00:55:55,872 --> 00:56:00,210
Okay, well, look,
identify the major brands

1364
00:56:01,477 --> 00:56:03,179
that fit with your brands.

1365
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:05,882
You know, stay on brand
is basically what I'm saying.

1366
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:08,084
Uh, oh, no.

1367
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:12,121
Oh, I hope this one doesn't
get interrupted, buddy.

1368
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:14,324
Well, why don't
we give a listen

1369
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,427
to what Franz Goldberg
has to say about brands.

1370
00:56:17,493 --> 00:56:18,895
Oh.

1371
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:20,263
You think they would have
just brought Franz here,

1372
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,899
but no, we got tape.

1373
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:24,601
<i>My audience likes
that I'm real.</i>

1374
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:27,170
- <i>They don't want to be fed...</i>
- It's just gonna go right...

1375
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:29,539
Oh, this is funny.
There... There's Dad.

1376
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:33,176
Well, hello there.

1377
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:35,645
<i>May I help you?</i>

1378
00:56:35,712 --> 00:56:37,614
I'm here to plant some seed.

1379
00:56:39,249 --> 00:56:41,817
He's a gardener.
You can tell by his hat.

1380
00:56:41,884 --> 00:56:44,387
Let me show you
where you can plant it.

1381
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:46,556
<i>Yes, come on.</i>

1382
00:56:46,623 --> 00:56:48,358
<i>That bush needs trimming.</i>

1383
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:53,863
My dad had
a lot of side jobs.

1384
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,798
- So did your mom.
- So did your mom, apparently.

1385
00:56:57,766 --> 00:56:59,469
So did my mom, apparently.

1386
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,439
Are there any questions?

1387
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:06,409
No?
No questions.

1388
00:57:06,476 --> 00:57:07,910
I-I didn't think so.

1389
00:57:07,977 --> 00:57:09,979
All right, well, I have
a few questions myself.

1390
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:13,616
- Thank you.
- <i>Well done, buddy.</i>

1391
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:15,018
<i>Well done.</i>

1392
00:57:15,084 --> 00:57:16,986
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Bring it in.

1393
00:57:17,053 --> 00:57:19,889
<i>Hey, Brian.
Dad's on his way.</i>

1394
00:57:19,956 --> 00:57:22,025
- <i>How did it go?</i>
- How did it go?

1395
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:23,660
- <i>Brian.</i>
- Yeah.

1396
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:26,262
<i>I didn't know who was
gonna be more embarrassed.</i>

1397
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:27,930
- <i>You or us.</i>
- Well, I'll tell you what.

1398
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:29,565
It didn't look like
you guys were embarrassed.

1399
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:31,534
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Quinn,
I'll be by next week

1400
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:32,635
to film the sequel, okay?

1401
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:34,203
All right, get out of here.

1402
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,805
Don't answer the phone
when they call anymore, okay?

1403
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:38,141
All right, love you, Ma.
I love you, Dad.

1404
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:39,509
I'll talk to you guys
in a little bit.

1405
00:57:46,015 --> 00:57:48,651
<i>All right, here it is.</i>

1406
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:50,386
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1407
00:57:50,453 --> 00:57:52,355
- There's an event going on.
- What is it?

1408
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:54,524
- Right now, what is it?
- Okay.

1409
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,160
- Sally, one of your closest friends is in town tonight.
- Yeah.

1410
00:57:57,226 --> 00:57:58,594
Jaden Smith has
a movie premiere.

1411
00:57:58,661 --> 00:58:00,396
Stop it.

1412
00:58:00,463 --> 00:58:02,332
All right, Sal, so now
you're Jaden's number one fan,

1413
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:03,933
and all you gotta do
is just walk around

1414
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,068
and let people know it.

1415
00:58:05,134 --> 00:58:07,403
All right, where's our boy?

1416
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:08,638
I feel like an idiot.

1417
00:58:08,705 --> 00:58:10,907
<i>Let me see
that tattoo, buddy.</i>

1418
00:58:10,973 --> 00:58:12,342
Hi, can I take a picture
of your tattoo?

1419
00:58:12,408 --> 00:58:14,210
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- Nice shorts.

1420
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:16,813
- I'm just his number one fan.
- Honestly, I see it.

1421
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,448
I really see it.

1422
00:58:18,514 --> 00:58:20,550
<i>Guys, now do you see
what I had envisioned</i>

1423
00:58:20,616 --> 00:58:22,085
so many seasons ago?

1424
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:23,319
All right, Sal, you're up.

1425
00:58:23,386 --> 00:58:24,620
Three, two, one.

1426
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,928
Look!

1427
00:58:31,994 --> 00:58:33,763
Jaden Smith, number one fan.

1428
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,698
I'm his number one fan.

1429
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:37,633
Act like
his number one fan, buddy!

1430
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,935
I'm his number one fan.

1431
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:40,169
You think
you're Jaden's number one fan?

1432
00:58:40,236 --> 00:58:41,637
- Yeah, I do.
- You got this shirt?

1433
00:58:41,704 --> 00:58:43,106
- I wish I had the shirt.
- You got the tat, though?

1434
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:44,574
- Let's do, oh.
- Come on.

1435
00:58:46,476 --> 00:58:48,911
- You know Jaden's blood type?
- There you go.

1436
00:58:48,978 --> 00:58:50,813
- Wrong!
- What is it?

1437
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,115
- A-negative.
- Yeah, right.

1438
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:53,449
Yeah, it is.

1439
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:55,752
Sal, I need a little bit
more crazy eyes.

1440
00:58:58,354 --> 00:59:00,189
- Has anybody seen him?
- Can I see your tattoo?

1441
00:59:00,256 --> 00:59:01,691
I gotta meet him.
I gotta meet him.

1442
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:03,259
Yo, pal, do you know
when the Q&A is with Jaden?

1443
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:04,827
Do you know when the Q&A is?

1444
00:59:06,229 --> 00:59:07,764
It's just wait and hold.

1445
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,165
Wait and hold?

1446
00:59:09,232 --> 00:59:10,533
- Do you know where Jaden is?
- What?

1447
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,034
- Do you know where Jaden is?
- I don't.

1448
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:13,002
- I'm so sorry.
- You're no help to me.

1449
00:59:15,571 --> 00:59:18,608
Jaden's movie has now ended,
and there's a Q&A afterward.

1450
00:59:18,674 --> 00:59:20,710
- <i>This is awesome.</i>
- <i>There he is.</i>

1451
00:59:20,777 --> 00:59:23,079
<i>There's Jaden.</i>

1452
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:25,848
Before we do that,
I just wanted to start off...

1453
00:59:25,915 --> 00:59:28,518
Um...

1454
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:29,519
<i>Hop up, Sal.</i>

1455
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:32,488
So I have
a million questions,

1456
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:34,858
but do we have some questions
out here from the audience?

1457
00:59:34,924 --> 00:59:36,125
Come on, buddy.
Get into it.

1458
00:59:36,192 --> 00:59:37,895
- Oh! Oh!
- Do we have a really good one?

1459
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,128
So we have a question
right over here.

1460
00:59:39,195 --> 00:59:41,297
Oh, yes!
Yes!

1461
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:42,999
Whoo!

1462
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:47,036
I'm just the number one
Jaden Smith fan.

1463
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:49,539
I'm just Jaden's
number one fan.

1464
00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:50,540
Can we hug?

1465
00:59:50,606 --> 00:59:52,175
Why don't you just
come on up here?

1466
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:53,409
Can I .really?
Oh, thank you guys so much!@

1467
00:59:53,476 --> 00:59:55,244
- Would you guys mind?
- Come on up!

1468
00:59:55,311 --> 00:59:56,813
- Thank you, thank you.
- <i>What Sal doesn't know</i>

1469
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,781
is that Jaden is in cahoots
with us this whole time

1470
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,851
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Oh, look at those shorts.</i>

1471
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:04,687
Wow, wow.
Come on over.

1472
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:06,656
Come on over.
Wow.

1473
01:00:06,722 --> 01:00:08,424
Thanks for coming out.

1474
01:00:08,491 --> 01:00:10,393
Oh, cool.
This is very cool.

1475
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,529
Thank you so much.
Ah, bam!

1476
01:00:13,596 --> 01:00:15,097
Wow.

1477
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:17,033
Are you serious?

1478
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,869
- That is...
- Oh, my God, ah!

1479
01:00:18,936 --> 01:00:20,770
- Are you serious?
- Ah!

1480
01:00:20,837 --> 01:00:22,371
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1481
01:00:22,438 --> 01:00:23,941
I got this a few years ago.

1482
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:25,374
Been waiting to show it to you.

1483
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:27,343
I just feel like
I look a lot different.

1484
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,479
Maybe we could
get it, like, redone.

1485
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:31,781
Sal, just say, "Well, I do
have this other thigh."

1486
01:00:31,848 --> 01:00:34,217
Revamped. Something.

1487
01:00:34,283 --> 01:00:35,184
- <i>There you go, Sal.</i>
- Just 'cause it's old.

1488
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:36,586
It's just old.

1489
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:39,522
You know, I feel like
if it was newer...

1490
01:00:40,423 --> 01:00:41,190
I...

1491
01:00:41,257 --> 01:00:42,758
I do have this other thigh.

1492
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:44,360
I could get an updated one...

1493
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:49,098
You need anything, buddy?

1494
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:53,035
- I'm good, I guess.
- Not you.

1495
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:55,104
Yes, I'm fine, Joe.
Thank you.

1496
01:00:57,573 --> 01:00:59,108
That's it,
I think we're done.

1497
01:00:59,175 --> 01:01:00,376
Yeah!

1498
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:03,012
We did it!
We did it!

1499
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:05,147
- Oh!
- Oh, I gotta see this!

1500
01:01:05,214 --> 01:01:06,182
Are you ready
to meet yourself?

1501
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:08,919
- Hold on.
- Three, two, one!

1502
01:01:08,986 --> 01:01:12,288
Oh, my God!

1503
01:01:13,689 --> 01:01:14,858
Whoa!

1504
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,626
That might be the best
tattoo I've ever seen.

1505
01:01:16,692 --> 01:01:18,794
This is definitely better
than the last one.

1506
01:01:20,429 --> 01:01:22,498
My guy.
My guy.

1507
01:01:22,565 --> 01:01:24,667
Jaden, we'll see you
in five years?

1508
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:26,937
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:28,437
Hopefully before then.

1510
01:01:41,183 --> 01:01:43,419
I know.
It's just like Ibiza.

1511
01:01:43,486 --> 01:01:44,720
Hey, bud.
What's up?

1512
01:01:46,756 --> 01:01:48,324
Is that the Molly?

1513
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:50,259
It's not the Molly.

1514
01:01:50,326 --> 01:01:51,761
DJ, bring down the beat.

1515
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:55,598
Uh, what is this shit?

1516
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:56,766
What's that, bud?

1517
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:00,369
Hey, hey, hey!
Here we go!

1518
01:02:00,436 --> 01:02:02,338
Now it's a party!
Later, Q.

1519
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,307
Okay.

1520
01:02:04,373 --> 01:02:05,641
Yep, all right.

1521
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,209
So that's what
he does at night, okay.

1522
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:35,504
Good boy.

1523
01:02:35,571 --> 01:02:37,874
Did you get the toys I sent?

1524
01:02:38,741 --> 01:02:39,742
Okay.

1525
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:41,410
Oh, oh, Benjamin?

1526
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:44,280
Okay, don't,
don't hang up, don't hang up!

1527
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:48,051
He hung up.

1528
01:02:48,117 --> 01:02:50,087
Well, Brian Quinn
misses his cats.

1529
01:02:50,152 --> 01:02:51,554
Your cats.
I miss my family.

1530
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:53,189
You know my daughter McKayla?

1531
01:02:53,255 --> 01:02:54,390
She rode her bike
for the first time yesterday.

1532
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:55,825
- Hmm.
- Wasn't there.

1533
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:00,563
- Milana?
- Who's that?

1534
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,066
Your daughter.

1535
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:04,433
Her name's Milana.

1536
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:07,370
Sweet Jesus.
How long have we been gone?

1537
01:03:07,436 --> 01:03:09,572
- Three days.
- What are we doing?

1538
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:11,307
All right,
we're four grown men.

1539
01:03:11,374 --> 01:03:12,842
We're out here jacking around,

1540
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:14,443
trying to fix a mistake
we made when we were kids.

1541
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,646
- It's stupid.
- Yeah, you know what?

1542
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:18,581
Maybe we didn't think
this one all the way through.

1543
01:03:18,648 --> 01:03:20,516
I've been getting
phone numbers, girls.

1544
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,318
Local girls
that want to meet me.

1545
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:23,285
But if you guys want to leave
and go home,

1546
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:24,420
I'm ready to go now.

1547
01:03:24,487 --> 01:03:26,389
- Yeah, yeah, me too.
- I'll go.

1548
01:03:26,455 --> 01:03:27,790
Yeah, I gotta get back to
what's-her-face, come on.

1549
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:29,960
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1550
01:03:30,027 --> 01:03:31,094
We're almost there.

1551
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,963
Sal, come on.
Going home, bud.

1552
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,964
- Come on, bud.
- No!

1553
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:37,700
We're not going anywhere!

1554
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,535
Sal, what are you doing?

1555
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,006
We're gonna finish
what we started.

1556
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:44,640
He's gone loco.

1557
01:03:44,707 --> 01:03:48,111
I didn't come here all this
way to turn around, to quit!

1558
01:03:48,177 --> 01:03:50,446
I'm not gonna go back home to
Staten Island so they can say,

1559
01:03:50,513 --> 01:03:52,883
"You know that great guy,
Sal Vulcano

1560
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:55,518
and his friends that he has,
they turned around.

1561
01:03:55,584 --> 01:03:59,522
They went all the way down
to Georgia."

1562
01:04:00,857 --> 01:04:01,958
Not today, babies!

1563
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:06,796
- Oh.
- I did it.

1564
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:10,232
Shut the fuck up.

1565
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:11,600
It's fine, all right?
We'll stay.

1566
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:13,402
We'll keep going.
Whatever you need, buddy.

1567
01:04:13,469 --> 01:04:15,072
We were just tired,
got a little homesick.

1568
01:04:15,138 --> 01:04:16,873
Yeah.
Put the board down.

1569
01:04:18,574 --> 01:04:20,843
Okay, great, 'cause as long
as we come to an agreement,

1570
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:22,278
'cause I just want
to see Abdul.

1571
01:04:22,344 --> 01:04:23,846
- Communicate.
- Thank you guys.

1572
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,214
All you had to do is say
let's keep going, we'll go.

1573
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:26,782
- I get emotional.
- We'll do it.

1574
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:28,919
You weren't really gonna
hit us with that, were you?

1575
01:04:28,985 --> 01:04:30,153
For me, it's unclear.

1576
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:39,963
I think this car breaks down
on the side of most roads,

1577
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:41,497
people are gonna stop and help.

1578
01:04:41,564 --> 01:04:43,066
- I agree.
- Yeah, I think so.

1579
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:44,667
I think they will
stop to help,

1580
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:46,970
but the question is, how long
will they stick around?

1581
01:04:47,037 --> 01:04:49,906
- Until, until it gets weird.
- Until it gets weird.

1582
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,807
How weird should we make it,
is the real question.

1583
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,443
- Guys, did we just make plans?
- I think we did.

1584
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,245
Pull over.

1585
01:04:56,312 --> 01:04:58,380
- We got some work to do.
- You got it.

1586
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:02,351
Park it right here.
Let's do it.

1587
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,758
- <i>All right, here we go.</i>
- Here we go.

1588
01:05:08,824 --> 01:05:10,459
<i>Sal, you broke down,
unfortunately, buddy.</i>

1589
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:12,095
Your object is to get people
to stop you to help you.

1590
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:14,497
Otherwise you're gonna be
standing down on the grass

1591
01:05:14,563 --> 01:05:16,867
next to a car
getting bit by mosquitoes.

1592
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:19,368
All right, well,
the quickest way to do this

1593
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:20,904
is to just
make them stop, right?

1594
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:23,173
I'm proud of you, buddy.
You're taking some initiative.

1595
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,740
Whoo!

1596
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:28,310
She's, uh, she's dead.

1597
01:05:28,377 --> 01:05:29,845
Whoo.

1598
01:05:29,913 --> 01:05:32,581
She went down
a couple miles back.

1599
01:05:36,153 --> 01:05:37,620
Hey, how you doing, man?

1600
01:05:37,686 --> 01:05:40,422
It's two guys, and I think
they might want to kill me.

1601
01:05:40,489 --> 01:05:41,690
Here we go.

1602
01:05:41,757 --> 01:05:43,492
Can't do no harm, no foul.
Bill.

1603
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,861
Hey, how you doing, Bill?
Sal.

1604
01:05:44,928 --> 01:05:46,529
Yeah, my name's Sal.

1605
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:47,964
- What's your name?
- Mark.

1606
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,431
Usually when something
goes wrong,

1607
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:50,800
I just blast something
up the tailpipe.

1608
01:05:53,602 --> 01:05:54,770
Usually something goes wrong,
I just

1609
01:05:54,837 --> 01:05:56,273
blast something
up the tailpipe.

1610
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:57,773
Up the tailpipe?

1611
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,508
Well, I mean,
first rule of thumb, right?

1612
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:00,810
You get broke down,
you gotta blast something

1613
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:02,344
right up the tailpipe,
and I was gonna

1614
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:03,612
blast something,
but I don't have nothing.

1615
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:04,981
That's what I thought you did.

1616
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,283
- No, no.
- No.

1617
01:06:08,651 --> 01:06:10,586
<i>Guys, why isn't
this fixed yet?</i>

1618
01:06:10,653 --> 01:06:13,190
<i>Yeah, Sal...</i>

1619
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:14,690
I don't know,
I don't even...

1620
01:06:14,757 --> 01:06:16,026
I wish I knew more
about the thing.

1621
01:06:16,092 --> 01:06:17,793
Well, what's the issue?
It's, I mean...

1622
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:19,129
I mean, you can't fix it
already or what's going on?

1623
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:20,629
We don't know
what it's doing.

1624
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:22,498
I mean, you know,
guys, you've been here

1625
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:24,267
a couple minutes already, guys.

1626
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,801
Tick-tock, Bill.

1627
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:27,270
This is really nice of
you guys, 'cause, you know,

1628
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:28,737
I never would've stopped
for you guys.

1629
01:06:31,274 --> 01:06:33,442
I mean, I gotta be honest,
you fellas are top-notch.

1630
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:34,610
It's...

1631
01:06:34,677 --> 01:06:36,012
Sal, you gonna say
that line or no?

1632
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,847
<i>Here we go, oh.</i>

1633
01:06:37,914 --> 01:06:40,083
I wouldn't have stopped for you
guys, so that's really nice.

1634
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,853
There wouldn't be no use
to stopping.

1635
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,653
Yeah, right, right,
right, right, right.

1636
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,857
The only thing I could suggest
if you guys were stuck,

1637
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:48,859
you could blast something
up your tailpipe, though.

1638
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,760
All right, bud,
head around to the trunk.

1639
01:06:51,827 --> 01:06:53,662
We've hidden something
in there for him.

1640
01:06:53,729 --> 01:06:55,764
I think I got something here.
Let me see.

1641
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,173
What the hell is that?

1642
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,740
Okay.

1643
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:10,247
Yeah, there's no string...

1644
01:07:10,313 --> 01:07:11,780
So, Sal, in the backseat,

1645
01:07:11,847 --> 01:07:12,916
we put a check
for good Samaritans.

1646
01:07:12,983 --> 01:07:15,384
This is, guys...
Mark, Bill...

1647
01:07:15,451 --> 01:07:16,920
This is the check

1648
01:07:18,088 --> 01:07:21,124
for good Samaritans
who stopped

1649
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:22,725
and pulled over to help me.

1650
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,760
This is a check for 5...

1651
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:27,097
Take that, Mark, go ahead.

1652
01:07:28,464 --> 01:07:29,698
Hello.

1653
01:07:29,765 --> 01:07:32,168
Mark's still rocking a flip.

1654
01:07:32,235 --> 01:07:34,938
You took the call right in the
middle of the check ceremony.

1655
01:07:35,005 --> 01:07:36,538
So anyway, guys, this is

1656
01:07:36,605 --> 01:07:38,141
from the Staten Island
Credit Union,

1657
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:39,775
this is a Good Samaritan check

1658
01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:41,311
for $5,000

1659
01:07:41,378 --> 01:07:42,745
for helping people in need.

1660
01:07:42,811 --> 01:07:44,047
- Ain't legal tender.
- <i>Try to rip it.</i>

1661
01:07:44,114 --> 01:07:45,614
You don't want it?
'Cause I'll...

1662
01:07:45,681 --> 01:07:47,683
Yeah, yeah, don't tear that,
don't tear that.

1663
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,551
<i>Oh.</i>

1664
01:07:49,618 --> 01:07:51,087
Thank you.
Bill, that's for you, man.

1665
01:07:55,392 --> 01:07:56,692
Murr,
you're walking funny.

1666
01:07:56,759 --> 01:07:58,094
Yeah, no kidding
I'm walking funny, Joe.

1667
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,561
Is it because of that thong
we put on you?

1668
01:07:59,628 --> 01:08:00,829
What thong?
This thong?

1669
01:08:00,897 --> 01:08:02,665
There it is.

1670
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,700
Dude, thank you.

1671
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:06,403
What's your name, bud?
What is it? I'm sorry.

1672
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:07,670
- Dennis.
- Dennis, I'm James.

1673
01:08:07,736 --> 01:08:09,005
I appreciate
you stopping, Denise.

1674
01:08:09,072 --> 01:08:10,839
I appreciate you stopping...

1675
01:08:12,876 --> 01:08:14,476
I appreciate you
stopping, Denise.

1676
01:08:14,543 --> 01:08:16,079
I don't know
the first thing.

1677
01:08:16,146 --> 01:08:17,813
Come around here, I'll show you
what I noticed before.

1678
01:08:17,881 --> 01:08:20,317
I noticed that before it was
smoking primarily from

1679
01:08:20,383 --> 01:08:21,450
from this area here.

1680
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:22,618
I ain't got time
for this, man.

1681
01:08:22,685 --> 01:08:24,187
- I don't even know.
- No?

1682
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:29,426
- <i>Murr loses again.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

1683
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:30,759
Did I just lose?

1684
01:08:30,826 --> 01:08:32,329
Did I just lose?
A thong was his weakness?

1685
01:08:32,395 --> 01:08:34,530
- <i>Murr, you gotta go again.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1686
01:08:34,596 --> 01:08:36,799
What, is this like
double or nothing?

1687
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,935
Thank you so much, man.
I appreciate it.

1688
01:08:39,002 --> 01:08:40,602
- James. Nice to meet you, bud.
- Good to meet you, man.

1689
01:08:40,669 --> 01:08:42,038
Here's what happened,
so I'm driving before.

1690
01:08:42,105 --> 01:08:44,341
But I don't even know
what I'm looking at, bro.

1691
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:45,774
Want to have a laugh?

1692
01:08:45,841 --> 01:08:47,576
Fake strangle me
when the next car pulls by.

1693
01:08:47,643 --> 01:08:48,744
You want to have
a little fun? Watch.

1694
01:08:48,811 --> 01:08:50,447
Okay, okay, okay, go.

1695
01:08:50,512 --> 01:08:52,248
When this guy pulls by, pretend
you're strangling me, okay?

1696
01:08:52,315 --> 01:08:53,749
Gonna do it.

1697
01:08:53,816 --> 01:08:55,484
<i>Flail your arms.
Flail your arms!</i>

1698
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:57,887
- <i>Flail, your arms.</i>
- No, keep going. Don't stop now!

1699
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:05,028
<i>Dude!</i>

1700
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:07,596
Nailed it.

1701
01:09:07,663 --> 01:09:09,698
Thanks, bud.
That was awesome.

1702
01:09:09,765 --> 01:09:11,567
You know what, dude, I'm so
glad that you pulled over.

1703
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:13,069
I'm so glad you pulled over.

1704
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:14,737
I was afraid it was
gonna be a woman and then...

1705
01:09:14,803 --> 01:09:16,239
I was afraid...
Nope, nope.

1706
01:09:17,706 --> 01:09:19,009
Nope, nope, nope.

1707
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:23,679
<i>Car's a real lemon
right now, buddy.</i>

1708
01:09:23,746 --> 01:09:25,949
There you go.

1709
01:09:26,016 --> 01:09:27,951
Oh, oh.

1710
01:09:28,018 --> 01:09:28,985
Oh, thank God.

1711
01:09:29,052 --> 01:09:30,519
Jump up and down
you're so excited.

1712
01:09:30,586 --> 01:09:33,722
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yay.

1713
01:09:33,789 --> 01:09:35,225
Clap, clap, clap.

1714
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:37,027
Yeah, yeah.

1715
01:09:37,093 --> 01:09:38,895
Turn around, do it
in circles, do it in circles.

1716
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:41,797
I have been waiting for
somebody to pull over so long.

1717
01:09:41,865 --> 01:09:43,933
Oh, yes!

1718
01:09:45,768 --> 01:09:47,404
Dude, thank you so much.

1719
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,339
Yay.
I love this car, man.

1720
01:09:49,406 --> 01:09:51,875
I've had this car for so long,
and then I was riding,

1721
01:09:51,941 --> 01:09:53,510
I hit a bump,
and then it just...

1722
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:54,643
It just died.
It won't go again.

1723
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,046
You believe that?

1724
01:09:56,112 --> 01:09:57,813
The old wagon's
down for the count.

1725
01:09:57,881 --> 01:09:59,082
It's just dead, man.

1726
01:09:59,149 --> 01:10:00,316
The wagon's
down for the count.

1727
01:10:00,383 --> 01:10:02,485
Yeah.

1728
01:10:02,551 --> 01:10:04,354
I lost my virginity
in this car.

1729
01:10:04,421 --> 01:10:05,922
So did my older brother.

1730
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:07,490
- So did my older brother.
- <i>My younger brother.</i>

1731
01:10:07,556 --> 01:10:09,259
- So did my younger brother.
- <i>My sister did.</i>

1732
01:10:09,325 --> 01:10:11,027
My sis,
my sister did.

1733
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:12,728
It was a hell of a night.

1734
01:10:12,795 --> 01:10:13,997
It was a hell of a night.

1735
01:10:14,064 --> 01:10:15,831
It was,

1736
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:16,832
it was a hell of a night.

1737
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,135
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1738
01:10:19,202 --> 01:10:20,736
You know what I got
in the trunk?

1739
01:10:20,803 --> 01:10:22,038
Yeah, show him
what you have in the trunk.

1740
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,642
<i>Yeah, that's about
a hundred pounds of cocaine,</i>

1741
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:28,278
and bags full of cash.

1742
01:10:28,344 --> 01:10:33,116
What we have here is about
a hundred pounds of cocaine...

1743
01:10:33,183 --> 01:10:34,517
You're not DEA, are you?

1744
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,186
You don't work
for the fuzz, do you?

1745
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:39,422
I'll tell you what, bro.

1746
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:40,957
- You didn't see nothing.
- Put that back in the car.

1747
01:10:41,024 --> 01:10:41,991
Hurry up.
Here comes a bus.

1748
01:10:42,058 --> 01:10:44,127
This is... A bus?
Oh, shit.

1749
01:10:45,395 --> 01:10:47,897
Do you think anybody saw me?

1750
01:10:47,964 --> 01:10:49,466
Do you think they saw my face?

1751
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:54,636
You never saw me!

1752
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:06,648
Guys, this is,
this is a whole thing.

1753
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:09,586
Joe, for no reason,
stop traffic

1754
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:11,254
and let cars go
indiscriminately.

1755
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:12,956
Let's stop a car.

1756
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:14,690
He's gonna walk
right into the road.

1757
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,760
Okay, take it easy.
I got 17 cars.

1758
01:11:20,463 --> 01:11:22,532
You're in.

1759
01:11:22,599 --> 01:11:23,732
Good.

1760
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:25,667
Good, good, good.

1761
01:11:25,734 --> 01:11:28,138
Come on, come on.

1762
01:11:29,906 --> 01:11:31,307
Come on, come on, stop.

1763
01:11:35,744 --> 01:11:37,080
There you go.

1764
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:38,647
Joe, both arms, windmill,
opposite directions.

1765
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:42,051
There you go.
There you go.

1766
01:11:42,118 --> 01:11:44,053
Guys, nobody will stop
to help me.

1767
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,122
What are you doing?

1768
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:48,024
Okay, this guy
just pulled over.

1769
01:11:51,628 --> 01:11:53,196
- Hi, I'm Joe.
- Mitch.

1770
01:11:53,263 --> 01:11:55,098
Mitch, good to see you, pal.
So the problem was I was...

1771
01:11:55,165 --> 01:11:56,798
I was driving down this road.

1772
01:11:56,866 --> 01:11:58,134
Keep him walking
around the whole car.

1773
01:11:58,201 --> 01:12:00,069
And then when I saw it,
I hit a bump.

1774
01:12:00,136 --> 01:12:01,803
And then I heard
a da-dunk-dunk-dunk.

1775
01:12:01,871 --> 01:12:03,640
Come on.
And a hit a buh-bump-bump.

1776
01:12:03,705 --> 01:12:06,209
And then when I hit it,
I heard a jiggle-jiggle here.

1777
01:12:06,276 --> 01:12:07,243
There was a jiggle.

1778
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,478
Take him around
the whole car.

1779
01:12:08,545 --> 01:12:09,811
Then on the other side here...

1780
01:12:09,879 --> 01:12:11,548
Joe, I need,
I need two full rotations.

1781
01:12:11,614 --> 01:12:12,982
This is here,
this is one car.

1782
01:12:13,049 --> 01:12:14,551
- This is one.
- Come on, take a walk with me.

1783
01:12:14,617 --> 01:12:16,920
So I saw back here that
this wheel started to like,

1784
01:12:16,986 --> 01:12:18,820
if you look, like,
this is on pretty good.

1785
01:12:18,888 --> 01:12:20,323
- Okay.
- But the other one,

1786
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:21,891
come on here, Mitch,
let me show you real quick.

1787
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,359
Oh, no, now you went
the other way. Shit.

1788
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:25,827
- He's undoing it, Joe!
- You're undoing...

1789
01:12:25,895 --> 01:12:27,297
You're undoing the loop.
No, you gotta come this way.

1790
01:12:27,363 --> 01:12:28,898
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- So now we're back on track.

1791
01:12:28,965 --> 01:12:30,832
So this will be
a second rotation, yeah.

1792
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,035
This hubcap is off.

1793
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:33,870
The other side,
the two came off.

1794
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:36,039
- Okay.
- This one here, hubcap.

1795
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:37,540
So I got two hubcaps.
So now...

1796
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:39,708
I think I actually need
three rotations, Joe.

1797
01:12:39,775 --> 01:12:41,611
Damn it.
How many rotations?

1798
01:12:41,678 --> 01:12:42,979
You need one more.

1799
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:44,414
What are you trying
to accomplish here, Joe?

1800
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,714
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

1801
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:47,183
Oh, no, I'm trying to get
the car to start.

1802
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,318
But I walked you through
what happened, come here.

1803
01:12:48,384 --> 01:12:49,552
Mitch, Mitch...

1804
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:51,321
You gotta look at this,
Mitch. Mitch, Mitch!

1805
01:12:51,387 --> 01:12:53,456
- Hold on, hold on.
- Joe, start hiding from him.

1806
01:12:53,523 --> 01:12:55,124
But I don't need...

1807
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:56,559
<i>Joe, he's not
gonna chase you.</i>

1808
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:57,961
- <i>Come on, Joe!</i>
- Hey, man,

1809
01:12:58,027 --> 01:13:00,563
you're gonna make me
leave you, man, okay?

1810
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,865
- Hey, man, I'm gone, man.
- No, no, Mitch, look at this!

1811
01:13:02,932 --> 01:13:05,335
No.

1812
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:07,136
Mitch, but look, you gotta
look at this last one.

1813
01:13:07,203 --> 01:13:08,638
- Come here.
- Mitch.

1814
01:13:08,705 --> 01:13:10,006
Mitch, you're my best friend.

1815
01:13:10,073 --> 01:13:12,041
We're best friends, Mitch.
Mitch.

1816
01:13:12,108 --> 01:13:13,809
All I'm trying to do
is help you.

1817
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:15,144
- <i>I know, I'm trying...</i>
- <i>You want to help me,</i>

1818
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:16,613
go around the car
one more time!

1819
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:17,614
- One more time.
- Okay?

1820
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,881
- Guess what.
- What?

1821
01:13:18,948 --> 01:13:20,650
- You gotta follow me.
- Okay. Deal.

1822
01:13:20,717 --> 01:13:22,485
I'm following you, Mitch.

1823
01:13:22,552 --> 01:13:23,785
- Joe...
- It's okay.

1824
01:13:23,853 --> 01:13:25,388
Joe, after this,
I'm going home.

1825
01:13:25,455 --> 01:13:27,290
Okay, you accomplished
your goal.

1826
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:29,158
I did.
I did accomplish my goal.

1827
01:13:29,225 --> 01:13:30,660
- And you have a good day.
- That's it.

1828
01:13:30,727 --> 01:13:32,662
Mitch,
you're unbelievable, buddy.

1829
01:13:32,729 --> 01:13:33,863
Thank you so much.

1830

Okay, so when you're making
a balsamic reduction,

1906
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,842
you really want to have
the flame at a nice simmer.

1907
01:17:05,909 --> 01:17:07,543
If the heat is too hot,
it's not gonna reduce

1908
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:09,145
the way you want it,
and the most important part

1909
01:17:09,212 --> 01:17:11,247
is to put the drizzle
right when it's hot.

1910
01:17:11,314 --> 01:17:13,549
And that's chicken, salads,
fish dishes, whatever?

1911
01:17:13,616 --> 01:17:15,785

It's about the presentaish.

a little bit.

feel right without Murr.

1923
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:21,150
Because he's not here,
I'll admit it.

1924
01:18:21,217 --> 01:18:22,451

still doing here?

what we set out to do.

Paula anyway.

What a night.
What a night!

2014
01:22:25,628 --> 01:22:27,130
- Yes!
- Unbelievable.

2015
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:30,066
Man, I'm so glad I threatened
your lives with that 2x4.

2016
01:22:31,268 --> 01:22:33,136
- Fellas, I love you.
- Yeah.

2017
01:22:33,203 --> 01:22:34,204
You're my best friends.

2018
01:22:34,271 --> 01:22:35,872
Epic, epic night, guys.

2019
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:39,809
Yeah, I don't say
this enough, but I... I...

2020
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:42,078
Hey, Fatone, you mind
keeping it down back there?

2021
01:22:42,145 --> 01:22:44,547
- We're trying to have a moment.
- Sorry.

2022
01:22:44,613 --> 01:22:46,682
I thought
I had known everything

2023
01:22:46,749 --> 01:22:48,051
there was to know about us,

2024
01:22:48,118 --> 01:22:49,618
but I learned
a few things on this trip.

2025
01:22:49,685 --> 01:22:51,353
Sal loves tigers.

2026
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:54,723
Yeah, Murr loves going to strip
clubs with his young nieces.

2027
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,725
Q's parents love
softcore porn.

2028
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,295
- No, no, they do not.
- They do.

2029
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,963
- They do not. They do not.
- They do, they produce it.

2030
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:01,764
I'll tell you
what the biggest thing, though,

2031
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:03,399
that surprised me
was how good of a hype man

2032
01:23:03,465 --> 01:23:05,467
- Joe turned out to be after all.
- Right?

2033
01:23:05,534 --> 01:23:08,470
Not bad, buddy.

2034
01:23:08,537 --> 01:23:10,974
I should talk to you boys
about something.

2035
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:12,541
An offer came in.

2036
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:14,376
Abdul wants me to go
full-time as her hype man.

2037
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:16,545
World tour.
Unbelievable.

2038
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:19,415
Seven-figure salary,
401(k), full benefits.

2039
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:21,617
Everything.

2040
01:23:21,684 --> 01:23:24,653
You know, she even offered me
my own reality show.

2041
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,356
"Believe the Hype:
The Joe Gatto Story."

2042
01:23:27,423 --> 01:23:29,425
I got a tricycle for McKayla.

2043
01:23:29,491 --> 01:23:30,659
Milana.

2044
01:23:30,726 --> 01:23:32,828
My own helicopter
they're flying in.

2045
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:35,631
She's gonna get rid
of that tapeworm.

2046
01:23:35,698 --> 01:23:37,499
Oh, you've had that
for years.

2047
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:38,869
Bye-bye, Charlie.

2048
01:23:38,935 --> 01:23:41,837
Everything I ever wanted
as a full-blown hype man

2049
01:23:41,905 --> 01:23:43,606
delivered on a silver platter.

2050
01:23:43,672 --> 01:23:45,175
Well, what did you say
to her?

2051
01:23:49,346 --> 01:23:50,881
- I said no.
- Oh, thank God!

2052
01:23:50,947 --> 01:23:52,249
I don't want to do it.
She said, "What are you doing?"

2053
01:23:52,315 --> 01:23:53,316
I said,
"I'm forever their boy."

2054
01:23:53,382 --> 01:23:55,051
I straight up told her no-no.

2055
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:56,152
You know what?

2056
01:23:57,386 --> 01:23:59,155
It's time to go back
to Staten Island.

2057
01:23:59,222 --> 01:24:00,456
Yes, it is.

2058
01:24:00,522 --> 01:24:01,858
Let me just go gas up
Grandma Lucia.

2059
01:24:01,925 --> 01:24:03,626
- We'll hit the road.
- Hold on, fellas.

2060
01:24:03,692 --> 01:24:07,463
Abdul texted me tickets
to go on her private plane.

2061
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:08,797
- Oh, all right.
- Oh!

2062
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:10,466
- That's awesome.
- Wait, wait, wait.

2063
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:12,869
She sent three tickets.
Come on!

2064
01:24:12,936 --> 01:24:14,503
Is she kidding me?

2065
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,804
- And it goes on.
- This is on purpose, right?

2066
01:24:15,872 --> 01:24:17,908
- Does she watch the show?
- Oh, that's great.

2067
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:19,376
Well, there's four of us.
That's an issue.

2068
01:24:19,441 --> 01:24:20,409
Well, then how
are we gonna decide

2069
01:24:20,476 --> 01:24:21,912
who gets to go on the plane?

2070
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:23,746
- I think it's been decided.
- Yeah, pretty sure.

2071
01:24:23,812 --> 01:24:25,248
- What do you mean?
- Did you not watch the movie?

2072
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:27,117
- That's for real, like...
- Yes.

2073
01:24:27,183 --> 01:24:29,585
- Yes, our show is real.
- But that's for real?

2074
01:24:29,652 --> 01:24:31,420
You think you have a shot
at a private?

2075
01:24:31,487 --> 01:24:33,189

01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:49,838
Oh, my God, guys.
We are living life.

2081
01:24:49,906 --> 01:24:51,774
- That's a jet.
- Yeah.

All right, all right.

2083

Grandma Lucia's already halfway
back to Staten Island, buddy.
